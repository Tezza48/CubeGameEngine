# Cube Game Engine
2D Game engine that renders sprites as 3D Cubes/Voxels.


To Use, Derive a class from `GLApp` and override `Start`, `Update`, `ProcessEvent` and `Draw`
```cpp
#include "GLApp.h"
class MyGame :
	public GLApp
{
public:
	MyGame() : GLApp("My Cube Game!") {}
	~MyGame();

	virtual void Start() override;
	virtual void Update() override;
	virtual void ProcessEvent(const SDL_Event & event) override;
	virtual void Draw(Renderer * renderer) override;
};

```

`Start()` Initialize your Textures here along with various game objects

`Update()` is called once per frame, Game Logic goes Here

`ProcessEvent()` is called every time an event happens in SDL (The library that deals with the window
and other system stuff). Check for keypresses and mouse clicks/movement Here.

`Draw()` is where you draw things using the `Renderer`


Implement you `main` as follows:
```cpp
int main(int argc, char**argv)
{
	try
	{
		RendererTest app;
		return app.Run();
	}
	catch (void *)
	{
		puts("Exception Thrown\n");
		return -1;
	}
}
```

---

Draw your sprite with `Renderer::DrawTexture()`

You can change the backcround colour with `Renderer::SetBackgroundColor`

Feel free to tinker with the behind the scenes renderer and base App and even the shaders.
